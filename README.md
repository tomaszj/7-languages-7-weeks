# Simple maze solver

This is a part of the solution for the key final task in Day 3 of Haskell in "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" book by Bruce A. Tate.

The task is to "Use a List monad to solve the maze.". My mind is fried enough after all Haskell-y goodness, so I settled for an ordinary maze solver.

If anyone has any suggestions on how to actually utilise a List Monad there, then give a shout.

## Running the thing

I've used Haskell for Mac IDE for doing these exercises, simple instructions are within the source code.
